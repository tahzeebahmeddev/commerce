# Django Auction Site

## Overview

Welcome to the Django Auction Site, a project that aims to create an auction platform similar to eBay. The primary goal of this project is to experiment with achieving Single Page Application (SPA)-like behavior using ReactJS in a Server-Side Rendered (SSR) MVT (Model View Template) architecture with Django. Additionally, the project features an integrated Google Authentication system for user login.

**Note: This project is a work in progress.**

## Features

- User Authentication: Integrated Google Authentication for user login.
- Listing Creation: Users can log in and create listings for items.
- Auction System: Items are auctioned in a manner similar to eBay.
- SPA-Like Behavior: The main listing landing page filters listings based on user input without reloading the entire page.
